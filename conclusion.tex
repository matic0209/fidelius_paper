\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclude}
%We introduced Fidelius, a novel system designed to enhance the security of data analysis in complex scenarios involving multiple roles. Leveraging Intel SGX and blockchain technology, Fidelius addresses the challenges of data leakage, trustworthiness, and verifiability of computation results. By employing static binary analysis and a privacy description language (PDL), Fidelius prevents data leakage in computation results, while its cryptographic protocol ensures the trustworthiness and verifiability of these results. Additionally, Fidelius utilizes local attestation to achieve consistent verification of analysis programs, reducing reliance on centralized services and improving efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that Fidelius incurs minimal overhead while outperforming existing solutions. Overall, Fidelius presents a promising approach to enhance the security of data analysis, offering a robust solution for protecting sensitive data in diverse and complex scenarios.
